# Machine Learning

Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so.

## Machine Learning Definitions:
There are 2 most famous definitions for Machine Learning. One is an older, informal definition given by <b>Arthur Samuel</b> as follows:

"<b>The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.</b>"

The other more modern definition is provided by <b>Tom Mitchell</b> as follows:

"<b>A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.</b>"

## Types of Machine Learning:
Machine Learning is broadly divided into 3 categories. They are:

1. <b>Supervised Learning:</b> Supervised learning is an approach to creating artificial intelligence (AI), where a computer algorithm is trained on input data that has been labeled for a particular output. The model is trained until it can detect the underlying patterns and relationships between the input data and the output labels, enabling it to yield accurate labeling results when presented with never-before-seen data.
2. <b>Unsupervised Learning:</b> Unsupervised learning, also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention. Its ability to discover similarities and differences in information make it the ideal solution for exploratory data analysis, cross-selling strategies, customer segmentation, and image recognition.
3. <b>Reinforcement Learning:</b> Reinforcement learning is a machine learning training method based on rewarding desired behaviors and/or punishing undesired ones. In general, a reinforcement learning agent is able to perceive and interpret its environment, take actions and learn through trial and error.
